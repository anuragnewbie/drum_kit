This is a drum kit playing site.

Six different musical instruments can be played by pressing particular
key or by clicking on those musical instruments itself.

I have developed this from the web development course taken by Angela ma'am
in Udemy.

I have developed it using html5, css3 and javascript.

Hope you will like it. 

Don't forget to make more modifications to it to make it more better and
dynamic. ðŸ˜€
